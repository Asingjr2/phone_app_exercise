Task: 
Create REST API that returns phone and user inforamtion when requested.

Approach:
I choose to use json-server to simulate calls to a db since it fast and requires no real configuration.
I created routes using express.Router to simulate the creation and request of data.
I created helper two functions to try and validate some of the possible information that 
could be submitted.

Limitations:
Although I tried to write good code, with more time I would add more testing around routes, 
and also around the requirements to create new information.
Additionally, the JWT token used for validation rely on a stock secert phrase.

Ways to Improve:
Much of the phone and user code mirrors each other, as an improvement I could refactor the validate functions so they can be shared.  
With more time I would explore the use of AWS services.
I would use cognito to validate used information which could be added to entries with 
new phones.  That data could be used to create update methods for user created items.  As an addon, AWS could also be used as a db with the RDS.  Or mongo or other types of db services could be used. 
I would also improve the way the JWT token is written to request use specific tokens 
based on personal info.
